🎮 Introduction
Ever wondered what it would feel like to recreate the iconic Pac-Man game — but with an AI coding assistant at your side? That’s exactly what I explored in this retro game challenge using the Amazon Q Developer CLI, combined with PyGame.

Amazon Q brought conversational coding to my terminal — no Stack Overflow hopping, no repetitive searching. Just asking, refining, and building. Here's how it went!

🚀 Setting Up the Developer Environment
To kick things off, I followed these steps:

Installed Amazon Q Developer CLI using:

bash
Copy code
curl -fsSL https://desktop-release.q.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/q-x86_64-linux.zip -o q.zip
unzip q.zip && cd q && ./install.sh
Logged in using Builder ID with q login.

Installed PyGame in my Python environment:

bash
Copy code
pip install pygame
I also joined the community Slack to see what others were building!

🧱 Choosing the Game: Why Pac-Man?
Among all retro options, Pac-Man stood out for combining puzzle elements with arcade challenge. It’s a perfect blend of:

Maze logic

Player interaction

Collision detection

Basic enemy AI

Plus, it’s universally recognizable.

💬 Building the Game with Amazon Q
Here’s the cool part: I built the game through conversation.

✅ Step 1: Basic Game Grid and Player Movement
I started with:

bash
Copy code
q chat
Then asked:

text
Copy code
Create a basic Pac-Man-style maze game in PyGame with a movable player and grid-based layout.
Q generated a complete working base with arrow key movement and walls. I tweaked the grid size and added my own layout.

✅ Step 2: Dots & Scoring
Next prompt:

text
Copy code
Add dots in the open paths of the maze and track score when the player collects them.
Q handled dot placement and collision perfectly — I just added sound effects later.

✅ Step 3: Ghost AI Enemies
The prompt:

text
Copy code
Add ghost enemies that move randomly. End the game if the player collides with a ghost.
Then I improved the AI by asking:

text
Copy code
Make the ghosts follow Pac-Man using simple pathfinding (BFS or random chase).
Boom — I had chasing ghosts!

✅ Step 4: Game Over & Win Conditions
I added prompts like:

text
Copy code
Show "Game Over" screen if the player hits a ghost, and "You Win" if all dots are collected.
Amazon Q even helped polish the user interface transitions between game states.

💡 Key Features of the Game
Grid-based maze with walls and paths

Pac-Man-style player movement

Dots that can be collected

Score tracking

Ghosts that chase the player

Game-over and win logic

🌟 Why Amazon Q Was a Game-Changer
Using Amazon Q CLI felt like pair programming with an AI who:

Understood game logic

Improved my Python syntax

Helped me debug instantly

Suggested enhancements I wouldn’t think of

It dramatically sped up development and reduced the need to search manually for tutorials.

🏁 Final Thoughts & Takeaways
This project reminded me how empowering tools like Amazon Q can be, even for something as creative as game development. Whether you're a beginner trying to understand PyGame or an advanced dev prototyping quickly — Q gives you momentum.

✅ I didn’t just build a game — I learned how to converse with code.
